*S*velte *T*ailwind _UI_ *C*omponents.

OPINIONATED, UNSTABLE, AND IN PROGRESS...

Ongoing effort to build reusable Svelte UI primitives as I need them, inspired by many
other libs, mainly:

- https://www.skeleton.dev/
- https://flowbite-svelte.com/
- https://captaincodeman.github.io/svelte-headlessui/
- https://www.svelteui.org/

Cherry-picked, combined, adjusted and tweaked to my personal preference and needs.
